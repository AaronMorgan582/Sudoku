# Sudoku

The Java code for a Sudoku solver, which was written by Aaron Morgan and Xavier Davis.

The code does require the Sudoku puzzle to be in a specific format and size (a 9x9 puzzle) in order for it to work.

There are two different impelementations for the solver; one that is done recursively, and another that is done with
normal iteration. The non-recursive solution is currently not working (Xavier Davis may have the finished, correct solution).

The Sudoku interface was created by our professor, Swaroop Joshi.
